# Classification in Imbalanced Dataset
Various Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification in imbalanced dataset

I have created a series of iPython notebooks to compare different machine learning classification algorithms in the case of unbalanced dataset. At the end of each notebook a comparative discuss is struck to argue which algorithm should be used and why.

P.S. I have received this assignment while when I applied for a job interview. I received a formal acknowledgement after turning in the assignment not to hear from them ever again. However, I am glad I found which algorithm performs better than the other during the ordeal.
