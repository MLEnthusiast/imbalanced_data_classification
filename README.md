# Classification in Imbalanced Dataset
Various Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification in imbalanced dataset

I have created a series of iPython notebooks to compare different machine learning classification algorithms in the case of unbalanced dataset. At the end of each notebook a comparative discuss is struck to argue which algorithm should be used and why.

The description of the dataset is provided in the notebook and enough inline comments to motivate the steps. Required libraries to be installed are also indicated in each page.

P.S. I have received this assignment while when I applied for a job interview. I received a formal acknowledgement after turning in the assignment not to hear from them ever again. However, I am glad I found which algorithm performs better than the other during the ordeal.
